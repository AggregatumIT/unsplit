unsplit - Resolve conflicts in Mnesia tables after network split

Author: Ulf Wiger, Erlang Solutions Ltd


NOTE: This application is currently a fairly crude prototype,
      and is not intended for mission-critical tasks (yet).

Documentation will follow, as soon as the approach has been
verified to work. So far, no Mnesia patches are used, but 
for it to work really well, some added functionality in
Mnesia may well be needed.
